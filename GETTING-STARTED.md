#Getting started

In this section we'll cover basics of the MetaUI rules framework `@ngx-metaui/rules` to assemble user interface on the fly without templates.
 

### Prerequisites
+ Knowledge of typescript 
+ Basic Web development
+ Angular 6.x

_Continuing without prior knowledge of all above is not recomended_ and result is unknown.

----

## Quickstart 

To get everything up and running run following commands:

#### Step 1

Create new angular application (unless you are integrating it with existing one)
```
  ng new MyDetailPage --style=scss
```


#### Step 2

Add `@ngx-metaui/rules` to your app
```
  cd MyDetailPage/
  ng add @ngx-metaui/rules
```

Once finished you are fully configured to start some rule driven development but we skip ahead generate some ready to use page!


#### Step 3

Create `UserDetail` page with different page modes:  `Create`, `Edit` and `View`  Even this does't do much it will show  
basic aspects of _MetaUI_.

```
ng g  @ngx-metaui/rules:mPage --modelClass=User --name=UserDetail 
```
and follow instructions printed in console such as `compile oss rules` _(We will get to this)_:

```
npm run compile:oss
```

### Step 4

Either attach created page into your router or like in our case  we will simply replace the out of box 
_welcome_ content of the  `app.component.html` with this line

```
<app-user-detail></app-user-detail>
```

### Step 5

Run the application 

```
ng serve
```
and access the page [http://localhost:4200][2] and you just created a page which is based on rules.



#### Let's Recap what just happened and what was created: 

*  `/model/user.ts` to represent our domain object
*  Component `UserDetailComponent` with just 3 main lines to generate whole content and 3 buttons to switch between `Create`, `Edit` and `View` 
modes
* A Rule file `User.oss` ( _OSS - Object style sheet_ ) to style how the object should be rendered and behave for different situations

The page should look like this showing different fields based on selected operation


#### Next Step 

Now we just touched the surface of the rule driven UI development and looked at other ways how web application can be 
built.

better introduction to the OSS Grammar.
